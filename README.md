## Hi, I'm Daniel Richardson

My passion for technology began in the late 80s when my father introduced me to his prized BBC Micro. This early exposure allowed me to learn programming with BBC Basic, sparking a lifelong fascination with technology. From a young age, I viewed programming as a form of magic—each line of code was like casting a spell, and it was exhilarating to see the results.

I thrive on the unique challenges of software development and have had the privilege of working with several esteemed companies throughout my career. After earning a bachelor’s degree in Information and Communication Technology with a focus on software development, I have gained extensive experience with various technology stacks. My expertise primarily lies in .NET and React, and I consider myself a seasoned professional in the industry.
